# Ansible Collection - hadi2f244.free_me

Ansible collection containing proxy and vpn clients

# Motivation

# Components

# Local Usage
It is recommended to install the collection by **ansible-galaxy collection** command, But there are some situtations where you need to edit the role by yourself. ####

> Note: I realy appreciate contributions. For example adding new protocols and also improving current roles such as adding new protocols to v2ray/singbox role templates.
